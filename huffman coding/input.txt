I was born in a city
Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
So this life's always with me
The ice inside my veins will never bleed
I was born in a city
Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
So this life's always with me
The ice inside my veins will never bleed
Uh, every time you try to fix me
I know you'll never find that missing piece
When you cry and say you miss me
I'll lie and tell you that I'll never leave
But I sacrificed (sacrificed)
Your love for more of the night (of the night)
I try to put up a fight (up a fight)
Can't tie me down (down)
I was born in a city
Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
So this life's always with me
The ice inside my veins will never bleed
I was born in a city
Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
So this life's always with me
The ice inside my veins will never bleed
